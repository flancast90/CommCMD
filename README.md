## CommCMD
Welcome to CommCMD, a JS terminal-like chat-app built on Node.js and Socket.io! The project is under MIT License, which means anyone can edit, distribute, or fork any part of the project, although attribution would be great! This project started out as a way to test what I've been learning with socket.io, but with so many chat-apps already out-there, I wanted to make something a bit different. What you can see here with CommCMD is my best effort at doing this! Enjoy!
